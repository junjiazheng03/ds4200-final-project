        <h1>Project Introduction</h1>
        <p>Our topic is Analyzing Goal Scoring Patterns in Professional Soccer. A detailed look at the locations, 
           timing, and types of goal-scoring actions in professional soccer matches, identifying key patterns and strategies. 
           To achieve this we set out some tasks that we hoped to accomplish by analyzing the data for example:
           <li>Investigating where on the pitch and when during the match goals are most likely to be scored</li>
           <li>Finding out what the most common goals scored were</li>
           <li>Discovering where the most shots are being taken</li>
           <li>Charting when goals are most likely to be scored and when teams are more effective in goal-scoring</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Data Visualization Overview</h2>
        <p>We used data provided by Statsbomb that covers over 90 global football leagues
            <li>Statsbomb is a football database renowned for its comprehensive football data</li><br>
            The best thing about stats-bomb is that it collects data from every second of the match, such as,<br>
            <li>Player position</li>
            <li>Actions Occuring</li><br>
            This allows for the data to be used to recreate the pitch in visualizations as well as to gain data on every single thing that occurs on the pitch relevant to football.<br>
            We focused solely on data relevant to goal-scoring—like shot angles, distances, and player positions—while categorizing goals to delve into their nuanced characteristics.<br>
            Since we focused on the World Cup, country/continent data was also relevant for us which we sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hserdaraltan/countries-by-continent">
            Kraggle</a>.

            <h3>Top 10 Type Count Barchart</h3>
            <img src="Top_10_type_barchart.png" alt="Top Ten Types">
            <p>The bar blot above shows the counts of the top ten action types performed during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We wanted to
                give the viewer a fairly simple overview of the different types as well as how many were performed. We especially wanted to 
                present just how large the data set was. When comparing them, it is clear to see that the most common type was a pass.
                This makes sense since players pass back and forth constantly. What is also interesting is that there were fewer receptions
                than passes showing how players would sometimes miss the pass or it would be intercepted.

            <h3>Shot Density Heat Map</h3>
            <img src="Heat_map.png" alt="Shot Density Heat Map">
            <p>This heat map displays the density of where shots were taken from during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This was done by splitting the
                pitch into 25 by 25-pixel squares and then counting the number of shots taken in that area. This count was then translated to a
                color in the gradient. The map clearly shows that the majority of the shots taken were directly in front of the goal. This 
                shows how the teams focused on a direct and centered attack strategy, opting to make big game moves in the center of the field.</p>

            <h3>Goal Distribution by Match Phase and Team</h3>
            <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js"></script>
            <script src='main.js'></script>
            <p>This D3 bubble chart vividly displays the distribution of goals across
                different match phases in the Qatar 2022 World Cup, categorized by continent. Each bubble represents a team, 
                with its size proportional to the number of goals scored during a specific phase of the game—Early Game, 
                Mid-Game First Half, Mid-Game Second Half, and Late Game. The colors of the bubbles are strategically used 
                to indicate the continent to which each team belongs, enhancing the visual differentiation and making it easy 
                to identify geographical patterns in playing styles or strategies. This visualization not only serves as a 
                tool for exploring how different teams perform throughout various stages of a match but also highlights
                the influence of continental football cultures on team performance. </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Non-Penalty Goals</h3>
            <iframe src="interactive_non_penalty_goals_chart.html" title="Interactive Non-Penalty Goals Chart" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
            <p>This interactive chart intricately maps out the distribution of non-penalty goals throughout the duration of football matches, 
                offering a granular view of scoring patterns that go beyond mere statistics. By meticulously aggregating shot data and representing it across match minutes, 
                viewers are invited to explore the strategic timings and frequencies of goals. Each bar in the histogram corresponds to a specific minute in the game,
                with its height indicating the number of goals scored during that minute, excluding penalties. 
                The color intensity of each bar represents the average expected goals (xG) value, providing insights into the quality of scoring opportunities. 
                This visualization not only encourages a deeper understanding of game dynamics but also enables an analysis of teams' attacking prowess and resilience under pressure. 
                By interactively selecting ranges within the histogram, users can uncover detailed xG statistics, 
                fostering an appreciation for the nuanced strategies teams employ across different phases of a match. </p>

            <h3>Shot Map</h3>
            <iframe src="interactive_shot_map.html" title="Interactive Shot Map" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
            <p>This dynamic shot map offers an immersive exploration into the spatial and qualitative aspects of shots taken in football matches, 
                encapsulating the essence of scoring opportunities and defensive challenges. By plotting each shot based on its field location, 
                the visualization reveals patterns of play and strategic approaches to goal-scoring. Colors denote the expected goals (xG) value for each shot,
                transitioning from cooler to warmer hues to illustrate the likelihood of each attempt to find the back of the net. 
                Users can hover over individual shots to reveal detailed information, including the minute and second of the attempt, the player responsible, 
                and the team's name, enriching the narrative of the match with every interaction. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, this shot map serves as a powerful analytical tool,
                enabling fans, analysts, and coaches alike to dissect team formations, pinpoint areas of strength and vulnerability, and strategize with precision.
                It encapsulates the drama and anticipation of every shot, transforming raw data into a vivid storyboard of matchday action. </p>

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the data analyzed allowed for a few observations to be made from the patterns shown, such as:
            <li> The majority of goals were scored from positions directly in front of the net, highlighting the importance of central attacking plays. </li>
            <li>A significant number of goals occurred in the middle to later phases of matches, indicating teams' increasing offensive efforts or defensive fatigue as the game progresses. </li>
            <li>When excluding penalty goals, the trend of scoring predominantly in the latter half of matches suggests a tactical shift or increased opportunities as matches unfold.</li>
            <li>Including penalties, data shows a spike in goals towards the end of matches, underscoring the critical moments and high-pressure situations often present in the closing stages.</li>
            <li>The analysis underscores the strategic value of both positioning and timing in goal-scoring opportunities, with penalties playing a pivotal role in match outcomes, especially in late-game scenarios.</li>
            <br>
            In the future, we will consider looking into what positions are most prominent in affecting goal scoring as well as what plays before lead to the most goals.  We will also look into how the opposition’s 
            goal-scoring affects  a team’s goal-scoring.
